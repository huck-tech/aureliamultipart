                <h4 class= "text-left">How much money can I make?</h4>
                <p>It all comes down to quantity, quality, and variety. Clippn is here to help you make as much as possible. We know some stock footage shooters who do this full time and make a good living at it. Remember to keep uploading because your clips will sell year after year. Your continued effort will pay off in multiples.</p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">Which distributors are you working with?</h4>
                <p>We only work with the world’s top distributors who have the experience and means to maximize sales #s. Our distributors are our true partners in that they rely on us to supply them with high quality, curated content. We rely on them to sell it. To that end, we don’t send your clips to every distributor – some only accept certain kinds of footage, others might be better suited to selling your type of content. So there are tactical decisions we make for distribution based on your clips to optimize revenue. You can see where your clips are selling on the Sales page.</p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">Can I submit SD archival?</h4>
                <p>We are trying to future proof our content by focusing on higher resolutions, like 4K and above. This will mean that your clips will be selling for longer time and will make more money in the long run. That said, if you think you have some unique SD archival footage, we’re happy to take a look to see if it has potential to sell. Contact your rep or email us directly at <a href= "mailto:info@clippn.com">info@clippn.com</a>, and please give us as much detail as possible.</p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">Do I have to export my footage before sending?</h4>
                <p>No! That’s why we’re here so you don’t have to do that. If you are shooting new footage continually, you should know by now about our best practices (from the onboarding video and Clippn University), so you should be editing as much in-camera as possible. This does help us process and distribute your clips faster, and it also boosts your yield %.</p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">How long does it take to get paid?</h4>
                <p>Our goal is to pay you as quickly as possible. We pay you within 30 days of receiving payment from the distributor where the clip was sold. Most of them have 30 days to pay us from the time of sale, though some have a longer turnaround time. </p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">What kind of content are you looking for?</h4>
                <p>We are looking for unique clips. The Variety Matrix will give you ideas for specific shots that can sell.</p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">Do you accept GoPro?</h4>
                <p>Definitely.</p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">Do you accept raw RED?</h4>
                <p>Yes we do.</p>
                <h4 class= "text-left">Do you buy content?</h4>
                <p>Clippn does not buy content – we are a wholesale model, distributing your clips through the world’s leading distributors. You always own your content. But if you have a unique collection that you are looking to sell outright, we might be able to assist in getting your footage ready-for-sale and identifying potential buyers. Email us directly at <a href= "mailto:info@clippn.com">info@clippn.com</a> and give us as much information as possible.</p>
