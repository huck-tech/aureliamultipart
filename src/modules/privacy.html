                <h2>Clippn.com</h2>
                <p><em>Last Updated: <strong>[10/28/15]</strong></em> </p>
                <p>We at Clippn Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”) have created this privacy notice (this “Privacy Notice”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Notice relates to our information collection and use practices in connection with our website located at www.clippn.com. By visiting our site or providing us with any information through our site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Notice and the accompanying <a title= "Terms of Use" href= "/#/dashboard/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>. </p>
                <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>In the course of operating our site, we will collect and/or receive the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and/or receive such information.</p>
                <h3>Personal Information.</h3>
                <p>If you contact us through our site, you will need to provide your name and e-mail address. If you wish to apply to become a Clippn Contributor, you will be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address and zip code. We will use this information to determine, in our sole discretion, if you qualify to become a Clippn Contributor, and, if we determine that you do, we will use your Personal Information in connection with our obligations under the Clippn Contributor Agreement entered into by you and us. All information we collect and/or receive under this section is collectively called “Personal Information.” We only collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide us with such information.</p>
                <h3>Financial Information.</h3>
                <p>If you become a Clippn Contributor, you will be required to provide certain financial information, so that we can submit payments to you pursuant to the Clippn Contributor agreement entered into between you and us. Such information is referred to herein as the “Financial Information.” We do not store or process your Financial Information; instead, we engage third party service provider(s) to process payments on our behalf. You authorize such third-party service provider(s) to collect, process, and store your Financial Information. Our third party service provider(s) may request that you provide certain personal data (e.g., a valid government issues ID, your legal name, address and date of birth) for the purpose of processing payment through its financial institutions and complying with any applicable federal or state laws or regulations. Our third party service provider(s) may also communicate directly with you regarding any issues with a payment. Information collected by our third party service provider(s) is used by such third party service provider(s) in accordance with their own privacy practices and not in accordance with the privacy practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
                <h3>Other Information.</h3>
                <p>In addition to the information noted above, we may collect additional information (the “Other Information,” and together with the Personal Information and the Financial Information, the “Information”). Such Other Information may include:</p>
                <p><strong>a. From You.</strong> Additional information about yourself that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g., via a survey), such as household income range, gender, product and service preferences, and other information that does not identify you personally. </p>
                <p> <strong>b. From Your Activity.</strong> Information that we automatically collect when you use our site, including, without limitation:
                    <br> • IP addresses, which may consist of a static or dynamic IP address and will sometimes point to a specific identifiable computer or device; browser type and language; referring and exit pages and URLs; date and time; amount of time spent on particular pages; what sections of our site you visit; and similar data; and
                    <br> • Information about your device, including the type of device; universally unique ID (“UUID”); advertising identifier (“IDFA”); MAC address; operating system and version (e.g., iOS, Android or Windows); carrier and country location; hardware and processor information (e.g., storage, chip speed, camera resolution, NFC enabled); network type (WiFi, 3G, 4G, LTE); and similar data.
                    <br> <strong>c. From Cookies.</strong> Information that we collect using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using our site. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, our site may not function properly. </p>
